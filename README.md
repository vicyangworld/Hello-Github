This is my first touch with GitHub, really excited and I can't help but say "Hello, GitHub"
Vic Yang here, I love programming and new technologies. And unfortunately, computer science is not my mayer major when i was in school. But so what? I love it and do it, just like working out on gym to bulid my body, that's my another hobbit.
