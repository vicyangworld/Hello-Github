# hello-world-And-BLESSINGS-for-Liuyu
This is my first touch with GitHub, really excited and I can't help but say "Hello, GitHub"
Vic Yang here, I love programming and new technologies. And unfortunately, computer science is not my mayer major when i was in school. But so what? I love it and do it, just like working out on gym to bulid my body, that's my another hobbit.
Ok, this is the second edit for this file because I suddently remembered taday is first day that my first woek tutor(I graduated from China University of Petrolium, yes, my major is geophysical engnieering), named Liuyu, leaves this company and will entry Alibaba group. Congratulations from bottom of my heart. I like this guy very much not only because of his help. He is really obsessed with new technology and you know he is definitly energetic. The deepest impression he given me is the learning spirit. Also as a non-professional ITer, I dare to promise you that he is a more excellent solfengineer than many other professional ITer. He is exactly the learning example of mine.
OK! The words above could be consider as the most heartfelt blessing and miss of him.
